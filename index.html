          Hello, and welcome to my brand new website. If you've found yourself here, I've either shared the link directly with you or you've navigated here via links on my other
          platforms. Regardless, I'm glad you've decided to visit. This is my first endeavor building a website as an amateur developer, so feel free to inspect my code through
          the site's repository on my github page. I appreciate any criticisms or compliments you wish to send my way. As is most likely evident, this site is still a work in 
          progress, so please check back soon for updates. I do my best to work on it every day, and you can expect changes at that same interval. Thank you.
